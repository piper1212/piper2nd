# Android Assignment

In this assignment you will be completing the implementation of a basic task list app by filling in 7 different TODOs representing missing parts of a fully functional app. 

The app will have two Activities, `MainActivity` and `AddTaskActivity`

The project folder contains 7 TODOs in 4 different files:

`MainActivity.java` contains TODO 1, 3, 5

`TaskManagerSingleton.java` contains TODO 2

`activity_add_task.xml` contains TODO 4

`AddTaskActivity.java` contains TODO 6

`ExampleUnitTest.java` contains TODO 7


Note that some of the TODOs (particulary the ones implementing Intents and Bundles) are dependedent on the implmentation in both of the Activities

Although it is not essential, you may want consider doing these TODOs in order as the concepts are somewhat sequential.

Please refer to the Android Tutorial videos posted to Canvas for implementation tips.

Here is a video displaying the correct functionality of the app that you should strive for: https://youtu.be/Fdn-mDC2STc
